I'm Dennis Lee, a fourth year undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and minoring in Math. I am fortunate to be part of [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/)'s group, currently working with [Ignasi Clavera](https://iclavera.github.io/) on deep reinforcement learning and robotics. Our research is focused on meta learning and task identification. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, video games, and keeping fish. I am also a member of the Cal Archery team.
