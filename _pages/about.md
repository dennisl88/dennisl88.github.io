I'm Dennis Lee, an AI Resident at Google. I am working on autoformalization and representations for mathematical statements, under the guidance of Dr. Christian Szegedy and Dr. Markus Rabe. I am also working on multi-agent reinforcement learning for robotics with Dr. Aleksandra Faust.


Previously, I was an undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and minoring in Math. I was fortunate to be part of [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/)'s group, working on deep reinforcement learning and robotics. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, video games, and keeping fish.
